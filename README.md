# Deep-Q-Learning-Racing-Kart

## Project Description

PySuperTuxKart is a racing game library that allows for sensorimotor control experiments. The
objective of this project is to teach the agent, the kart, to drive around the tracks as fast as possible through deep Q reinforcement learning. As it currently stands the Kart seems to learn slowly after many episodes of traning however it can be improved. A full descitpion of the project is provided through this pdf: https://github.com/laythamra28/Deep-Q-Learning-Racing-Kart/blob/main/EC418%20Final%20Report.pdf
