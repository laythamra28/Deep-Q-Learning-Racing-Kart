# Deep-Q-Learning-Racing-Kart

## Project Description

PySuperTuxKart is a racing game library that allows for sensorimotor control experiments. The
objective of this project is to teach the agent, the kart, to drive around the tracks as fast as possible through deep Q reinforcement learning. The objective will be assessed by recording how fast the kart is able totraverse the track.
